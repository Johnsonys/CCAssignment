/**
Problem: Dominos
Solution: 
The chessboard initially has 32 black and 32 white squares. When two diagonally opposite
corners have been cut off. We have 30 black and 32 white squares in the chessboard.
Every domino must take 1 white and 1 black square. Now we have 31 dominos, so they must take
31 white and 31 black squares. Therefore, it is impossible that using the 31 dominos to 
cover the entire board.
