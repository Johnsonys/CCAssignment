Problem: Blue-Eyed island
Assume there are n blue-eyed people
Solution:
Case n = 1
After the blue-eyed person on the island look around and realize that no one else
has blue eyes. Since he knows that at least one person has blue eyes, so he must know
that man is he. Therefore, he would take the flight that evening.
Case n = 2
The two blue-eyed people look at each other, but they are unsure whether n = 1 or 2. But 
they know if n = 1, the blue-eyed person would leave on the first night. Therefore, 
if the other blued-eyed person is still there on the first night, he must deduce that
c = 2 and he has blued eyes too. So both man would then leave on the second night.
Case n > 2
The same rule applies. 
Therefore, it will take n nights for the blue-eyed men to leave and all of them would
leave on the same night.
