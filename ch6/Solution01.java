	 THe heavy pill:
	 You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of 
	 weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find
	 the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.
	 Solution:
	 We take 1 pill from Bottle1, 2 pills from Bottle2, 3 pills from Bottle3, ...
	 20 pills from Bottle20
	 So the number of heavy Bottle = (sum of pills taken out - 210 grams) / 0.1 grams
